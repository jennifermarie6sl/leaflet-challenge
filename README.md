## Leaflet/Mapping Challenge
In this project we are pulling data from an specific data set from an API call to USGS GeoJSON's feed.  This data was mapped using Leaflet to plot the earthquakes by magnitude, mapped as different colors and sizes to reflect their size and depth.  The mapping includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked as well as a legend.  

Once the step above was completed we plotted a separate data set to show the tectonic plate locations so viewers could see the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. The data for this mapping can be found at https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates.  The map layers as well as earthquake/tectonic layers all work through independent controls.
